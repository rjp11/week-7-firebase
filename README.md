NU CBC Homework #7

This project is my first exposure to utlizing firebase for real time data storage.

The application displays Train Name, Destination, arrival frequency and minutes until next arrival.
The user can input additional trains in the form below the Current Train Schedule panel.

The user enters the Train Name, Destination, time of day the first train of that type arrives, and the frequency of their arrival.

Upon submittal, the information will be displayed on the Current Train Schedule above. The time until next arrival and minutes away are not stored in firebase, but are calculated utilizing the moment.js library.
